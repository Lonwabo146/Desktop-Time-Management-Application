# Desktop-Time-Management-Application
I was tasked to do a C#  time management system.
This C# project allows users to input information about student modules, including module code, module name, credits, and class hours per week. 
It also provides functionality to calculate self-study hours based on user inputs.
Usage

    Enter the following information to add modules:
        Module code
        Module name
        Number of credits
        Class hours per week

    Click the "Add modules" button to add the module to the list.

    To calculate self-study hours:
        Enter the number of weeks in the semester.
        Select the semester start date.
        Enter the number of hours you studied.
        Click the "Calculate Self-study hours" button.

    View the calculated self-study hours and remaining self-study hours in the application.
